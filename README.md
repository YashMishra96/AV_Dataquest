Problem Statement:

Road transport in India is one of the most frequently used means of transport for a common man. Each year the number of vehicles on the road keeps increasing, but with that comes the risk of road-accidents and fatalities. In 2017 alone, almost 1.5 lakh people were killed in road accidents across the country.
To help the accident victims as soon as possible, 108 has been set up as a free emergency response service which provides integrated medical, police and fire emergency services. This emergency service is being operated in several states of India. In this dataset, you have been provided with the details of road accidents in Dehradun District of Uttarakhand State. Your task is to predict the criticality of the accident.
